				<p> <strong>SAS Users New Zealand (SUNZ), 2017 : Reducing the Time to Insight for New Zealand’s Most Challenging Questions</strong> </p>
				
				<p>The Social Investment Unit is championing a new way of working in Government. Reusable, scalable and automated processes 
				for analytics are not new, but are yet to be embedded in Government. This presentation will show what the SIU is doing differently, 
				demonstrate why it is useful, and provide some principles for working in a way that moves government further together.</p>
                
				<p><strong>2016 Victoria University invited talk: Changing the world with numbers - being part of a social investment analytics team. 
				A joint talk with Emily Mason</strong> </p>
				
				<p>Data science, advanced analytics, and social investment are Wellington's latest buzz words. In this presentation Emily will discuss 
				how analytic techniques are changing Government's approach to decision making. Big data and analytic techniques now allow us to take a 
				social investment approach by placing people and their experiences at the heart of government's decision making process, and by understanding 
				the real world impact of policy decisions on communities, families and individuals. Through this discussion Emily will illuminate the key skills 
				and competencies she looks for when building a social investment analytics dream team. </p>
				
				<p>As a key member of the social investment unit, and with the benefit of hindsight, Kylie will then outline what she wished she had known before 
				leaving university. She will discuss some tips and tricks she has picked up along the way that have helped in her career as a statistician. </p>
				
				
                <p><strong>Australian Statistics Conference, 2014: Using the census as a sampling frame: A rare opportunity to understand non-response bias</strong> </p>
				
				
				<p>New Zealand’s 2013 Census of Population and Dwellings was used as a sampling frame for two large household surveys: the Mori Social Survey (Te Kupenga) 
				and the Household Disability Survey. One opportunity when using the census as a frame is having demographic information (age, sex, ethnicity, income) about
				all sample units, including non-respondents. </p>
				
				<p>This talk will discuss how we used this information to better understand non‐response bias, and how we were able 
				to use this information to adjust for non-response using calibration. While using the census as a sampling frame has some advantages over alternative frames, 
				it also presents some challenges. These include; drawing a sample from a list frame where it is possible to select multiple persons per household, which increases 
				respondent burden, dealing with population groups that move often, and administrative challenges. This talk will discuss these challenges in more detail. </p>

				 <p><strong>New Zealand Statistics Association Conference, 2013: Using the census as a sampling frame: A rare opportunity to understand non-response bias</strong> </p>
				
				
				<p>Repeated talk, as above </p>
				
				
				<p><strong>New Zealand Statistics Association Conference, 2012: Identifying respondent groups in a longitudinal business survey sample: an application of dual 
				latent trajectory modelling </strong> </p>
				
				
				<p>Latent trajectory models can be used to classify different patterns of growth and decline across subjects over time. We apply these models to better understand 
				the survey response behaviour of New Zealand businesses over time. Based on model results we classify businesses into: Great Responders, Good Responders, Learners, 
				Over-time Drop-offs and Bad Responders. We find response behaviour in the first five months of a longitudinal survey is a strong predictor of future response behaviour.</p> 
				
				<p>We also show how business characteristics contribute to predicting response behaviour. Understanding these patterns is useful in the field when collecting longitudinal survey
				data. Our analysis provides insights into early detection of problematic responders, targeting of non-response intervention and a possible dynamic sample design in a longitudinal context.  </p>
				
				
				<p><strong>New Zealand Statistics Association Conference, 2011: Fisheries in Ng&#257;ti Kahungunu Rohe: Masters thesis presentation </strong> </p>
				
				
				<p>There are three (legal) mechanisms through which kai moana are taken from the coastal waters of Aotearoa New Zealand: Customary, Recreational and Commercial. 
				Data of high quality on the commercial catch are reported to the Ministry of Fisheries, whereas data on the Recreational catch are very patchy, being based on voluntary 
				reporting. Customary catch data are collected through kaitiaki, the iwi representatives who issue customary permits, and summary data are reported to the Ministry of Fisheries. 
				Currently these data are published only at very high aggregate level (Fisheries or Quota Management Areas), which do not allow for analysis or monitoring at finer spatial scales. 
				Te Ohu Kai Moana, who oversee Maori interests in fisheries at a national level, are developing new methods for collecting customary and recreational data from iwi, and are 
				piloting these in the Ng&#257;ti Kahungunu Rohe in 2010.    </p>
				
				<p>The aim of this project is to provide an improved view of the fisheries data that are currently being collected in the Ng&#257;ti Kahungunu rohe, including reporting results 
				at a finer geographical scale. Specific goals are: 1. Assess the quality of existing customary data (from Kaitiaki) and (if possible) recreational data (from voluntary reports 
				by individuals and boat clubs); 2. Combine these data with the commercial data from the Ministry of Fisheries to provide total catch estimates, as an estimate of stocks of key 
				species (e.g. paua, kina, snapper, kahawai), including temporal and geographical variation. </p>
